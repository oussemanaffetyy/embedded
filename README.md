# Tools for Embedded Systems Lab

## Objective    
The aim of this repository is to provide a solution for lab assignments relating to distance teaching of the embedded systems course at the Bielefeld University of Applied Sciences, Campus Minden.

## Introduction

We use the RISC-V based virtual prototyp of AGRA Uni Bremen (https://github.com/agra-uni-bremen/riscv-vp) so that we have a virtual embedded system with breadboard. Further, we provide examples based on parts of FreeRTOS and of SiFive Freedom-E-SDK. You find the corresponding licenses of these and their examples in their directories. 

## Instruction for our toolchain
1. We require a running Linux system (though macOS would work, too). Hence, a native Linux or a Linux virtual machine has to be set up. We give no support for setting up a Linux machine. The following packages should be installed: autoconf automake autotools-dev curl libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev libexpat-dev libboost-iostreams-dev qt5-default

2. We use Visual Studio Code (vscode) with various extensions, namely: 

	- C/C++ IntelliSense
	- PlatformIO IDE
	- RISC-V Venus Simulator
	The following extension are useful but optional:

	- GNU Linker Map files
	- hexdump for VSCode
	- Intel HEX format
	- LinkerScript
	- RISC-V Support
	- C/C++ Advanced Lint
	
    Please install vscode with the extensions (e.g. see instructions on the vscode website).
	
3. Install the SiFive framework with the PlatformIO in vscode.
	```bash
	code
	```
	Goto Platforms on PIO Home and search for SiFive under Embedded and install. Leave vscode.


4. Clone this project with submodules (in a terminal shell, use bash). We put everything in the home directory. Adapt the following steps for another destination. 
	```bash
	cd ~
	git clone https://github.com/U2654/embedded.git
	cd embedded	
	git submodule update --init riscv-vp
	cd riscv-vp
	git submodule update --init vp/src/core/common/gdb-mc/libgdb/mpc
	```

5. Build the virtual prototyp of a embedded board with the steps:
	- riscv-vp
	```bash
	cd ../riscv-vp/vp/dependencies
	./build_systemc_233.sh
	./build_softfloat.sh
	cd ..
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make install
	```
	- vp-breadboard
	```bash
	cd ../../env/redv/vp-redboard
	qmake 
	make
	```

6. Set environment variables (for bash, append to .bashrc in home).
	```bash
	export PATH=~/.platformio/packages/toolchain-riscv/bin:$PATH
	export PATH=~/embedded/riscv-vp/vp/build/bin:$PATH
	export PATH=~/embedded/riscv-vp/env/redv/vp-redboard:$PATH
	```

7. Again in the shell, check if everything works and build an example project. Start a vp-breadboard and vscode in the shell.
	```bash
	vp-redboard &
	code &
	```
	In vscode, open the folder \~/embedded/workspace/led and then the file led.c. Run the example using the gui (piodebug). 

	Open the preferences using the gui in vp-redboard. Choose the data path where config files etc. is located, this should be `~/embedded/risc-vp/env/redv/` and click ok. Open the `blink.json` file. 
	Push the connect button (second from left hand side). You should see a blinking led in the vp-redboard.

## For Windows: WSLg as an alternative to a virtual machine

WSLg is the Linux subsystem for Windows 11 and allows various Linux distributions to run natively on Windows.

There is also the Linux subsystem for Window 10, which is called WSL2, but this has no automatic graphical output.

[Click here to install WSL](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg)

Even though Linux-programs in Windows can be started with graphical output using WSLg, some still prefer a classic desktop. With the help of RDP this can be achieved.

[Set up RDP with WSL](https://www.nextofwindows.com/how-to-enable-wsl2-ubuntu-gui-and-use-rdp-to-remote)

From now on you can simply follow the Linux instructions.

Tip: The Windows version of Visual Studio Code can also be used for Linux.
